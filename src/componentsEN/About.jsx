Currently, I am studying at Handelsakademin in Gothenburg, where I am acquiring all the necessary skills and tools to shape my future in web development. Programming is a newfound interest that suits me perfectly because there are always new things to learn. What I appreciate most about programming is the creativity it entails and the fact that there are numerous ways to solve a problem. I am driven to learn new things and to evolve.</p>
